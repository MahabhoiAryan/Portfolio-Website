# Geeky Week - A Week into Portfolio Website.

### What is Geeky Week?

Build your portfolio website with us in the week long bootcamp with live coding everyday for a week.


### What is ReactJS?

React is a JavaScript library created for building fast and interactive user interfaces for web and mobile applications. It is an open-source, component-based, front-end library responsible only for the applicationâ€™s view layer. In Model View Controller (MVC) architecture, the view layer is responsible for how the app looks and feels. React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook.
